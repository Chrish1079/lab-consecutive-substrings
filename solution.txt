Solution Description:
The function `consecutiveSubstrings` generates all possible consecutive substrings from a given string.
It uses two nested loops: 
- The outer loop selects the starting index of the substring.
- The inner loop selects the ending index (non-inclusive).
Each substring is extracted using `string.slice(start, end)` and added to a results array.

Example:
For 'abc', the function produces ['a', 'ab', 'abc', 'b', 'bc', 'c'].

Time Complexity:
O(n²) — Because for each character in the string, the function iterates through the remaining characters to form substrings.
